<p>Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Rebecca Blake and this is where I will share with you about myself and my life and what I am up to. This serves me and you. It serves me by holding me accountable, and giving me a place to talk about my life where anyone can feel free to stop by at their leisure and check it all out. Or not. Something about the possibility of people being able to keep track of what I am up to makes me more likely to follow through. And I am interested in following through, and interested in putting structures (like this) in place to have me follow through on some really big ideas.</p><p>It serves you because my intention is to inspire, educate, entertain, inform, and offer many things that are meant to transform humanity.</p><p>I see a possibility for: peace for humanity, an unprecedented quality of life through connection, community, and revolutionary principals for living in and interacting with the beings and world around us.</p><p>I see it possible to experience, embody and discover currently unexplainable mysteries. I see it possible to elevate our language or methods of communication and understanding in order to explain these possible experiences such that they are available to all people. I see that as the possibility for causing a transformation in the very most core of our reality - our being. And potentially the beingness of our beingness. Through this shift, I believe we can alter the very atomic structure of our reality and its even finer workings such that the fundamental rules of life alter and shift creating an entirely new universe for life to occur in. I believe this shift is inevitable and that we simply must choose what we will participate in - the perpetuation of an old and dying universe or the creation and unfoldment of a new one.</p><p>We are children of God, no matter your faith this tends to always be the most fundamental understanding. Its not the words that are important, its the understanding behind it. It is often glossed over, excused away, or even threateningly discouraged to entertain the thought of one having the potential for Godliness. Its a potential... possible. Not necessarily the case... because you actually have the choice. And in making that choice you will discover experiences and opportunities in alignment with that choice.</p><p>I believe this is a universe of choice. And maybe the next universe isnt a choice. So if that were the case, then this is the part of the game our soul is playing where we get to choose who we will become. We get to design our soul. This is a universe of patterns and creativity, of thoughts, ideas, plans, and innovations. I believe we are innovating our souls with our every word and our very being. We are creating a future.</p><p>I believe that this universe is programmed to reflect what we are choosing (at every level of our experience of it). Because in order to have choice - we have to have duality. Even though its not real - we have made it real temporarily. And we also have to choose to forget our all-knowingness. We have to choose to experience "separatation" - even though its not real - in order to be able to forget, and then to be able to choose and re-discover our true identity.</p><p>This is why we are called children of God. We are tiny parts of something we cannot explain; we are awareness experiencing individuality in every point of of its infinity. If we can forget our individuality, we can experience our totality and know it to be true. In the end, there is only love. And in order to fulfill on an intention, we are playing a game and making things up. We have chosen to create illusion so we can have the choice of choosing truth.</p><p>To choose illusion is to be a part of something that is not real, instead of being a part of something that is. In the end, those who choose Love in all its present moment expressions, will be the ones who are truly alive. And they will have chosen to be alive through their being and their creatively empowered actions.</p><p>I am determined to live this kind of life. A present moment life. A heart centered life. A life of service to the greatness of all. A life of discovery, mystery, play, willingness, and Love. A revolutionary, chosen and created life. A masterful life. A life that contributes to others in the sharing of it.</p><p>I have no idea how this is going to go... and I invite you along for the ride.</p><p>What does this translate to in reality?</p><p>Currently I am working on a lot of different projects.</p><p>I have a big picture goal of creating a network of intentional communities. Communities that are primarily centered in larger communities, like cities and towns. These centers for living would have different types of residents and participants and would service the greater community by providing relevant experiences, education in improving ones quality of life through various practices (from Permaculture to Personal Transformation) that would be exemplified throughout the community itself. The community would essentially be a living working example of a self sustaining culture where everyone lives in a space of work and play through constant connection to lively and loving community while also working in harmony with the planet we share. These centers would serve as gathering places and event spaces holding relevant events, workshops, experiences and whatever else should be appropriate. </p><p>The people who live in these communities would have their own homes and private spaces, there would be temporary residences as well for people staying in a work/trade position. There would also be accommodations for travelers and campers to stay on short terms. There will be creative spaces like art studios, workshops, music rooms, and whatever is relevant to the individual community members. Those people would do things they love (like art, music, fine crafts, writing, creating events, permaculture, gardening, etc) while also contributing to the managing of community itself and various ways. These people would share profits from their work as necessary to help maintain the community. The community allows people to live a lifestyle free to do what they love in connection with those they love while also eliminating the need for a lot of personal money through all the shared resources and spaces. Specialists and leaders would travel teaching principals and practices to the various intentional communities within the network and the cities and towns they are a part of.</p><p>Each community would be a hub of resources, goods, farmers markets, events, experiences, workshops, classes, tours, spiritual development opportunities, retreats, and much more. They would be centers for culture and truly sustainable living inspiration.</p><p>I call this Renaissance Humanity. Its a huge picture idea... and it is possible. So I am starting small by doing my best to live my own life this way. I am starting my own business, offering my services, growing food and doing my best to SHARE as much as I can.</p><p>Stay tuned to learn more!</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
